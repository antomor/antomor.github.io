      <title>Git: Move Files Retaining History</title>

      <description>Sometimes ago we need to create a new product, that shares many functionalities with the existing one. The first idea was to extract some of the code in a library, to be then imported and used independently in the two projects.
After creating the repository for the library, the first action I would have done was copying the files from one repo to another. Well, it works like a charm, it’s fast and it doesn’t require any particular expertise, a normal drag and drop operation.</description>

      <description>Some months ago, I was creating a web page to show some aggregated data, but I soon noticed the API used to retrieve the data was very slow. After investigating on the possible issue, we discovered the bottleneck: the database. The solution was to re-structure the data to make it consumable from a web page.
Although I had used sometimes the SQLServer profiler, I had no experience about MongoDB profiler, so here below the steps involved to analyse a MongoDB query.</description>

      <title>Security Headers on Static Websites</title>

      <description>When I started this blog, I evaluated many options:
 blogging platform vs static-generated website self-hosted vs hosted solutions costs and many more.  I ended up trying to build something very simple, consisting in a static website hosted on GitHub Pages. With this solution, I have been able to cut the cost on any host solution, since that, being a dev, I am quite comfortable in writing in a text editor.</description>

      <title>SPA deployment with GitLab</title>

      <description>In the last projects, I started using GitLab, not only as git repository server, but also as DevOps platform. So here I am going to describe a very simple architecture to deploy a single page application using Docker and docker-compose, nginx. In this specific project I used also dotnet-core for the back-end API and VueJS as front-end framework, but it is language-agnostic, meaning that you can replace whatever back-end or front-end you prefer.</description>

      <description>Preamble This article is not intended to cover the whole testing process due to its vastness. Having a glance at its Wikipedia page could give an idea of it. I am going to cover only the tip of the iceberg, but it is important to remind that bugs cannot be eliminated from the software, but in contrast, they must be discovered as soon as possible.
 The higher is the time passed since the bug come into the system, the higher is the cost to fix it.</description>

      <description>Here in this post, I am going to explain why I am starting writing something on INTERNET and what I am going to share. I perfectly know that there are so many sites today, describing almost everything, but these are only some of the reasons which drive me at this point:
 to improve my language skills; to improve my online presence; to receive feedbacks (feedback is the key to grow up); to share what I do (and how, I am going to list also some of my biggest mistakes).</description>

      <description>Hi, I am Antonio, a polyglot Software Engineer.
I like facing code challenges, learning programming languages and exploring software security, which is my secret hobby.
I try to practice any kind of sport, from running to swimming, from soccer to yoga, and I have recently added boxe to the list :-).
I would like to spend most of my time traveling, exploring the world. Next places I plan to visit: Norway, Spain, Portugal, Greece.</description>
