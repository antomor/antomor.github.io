      <description>In many cases we would change the content of a component dynamically, like for instance, to allow the user to change view or to let the children render the data retrieved and elaborated from its parent component. Here below we are going to show some techniques to create a component without deciding how the data would be shown. According with the application needs, each technique has its own strengths, but all of them encourage component reusability.</description>

      <description>What is CSP CSP stands for Content Security Policy and it is a security mechanism that helps to protect or mitigate some common attacks such as XSS (Cross-site scripting). It can be set by means of Content-Security-Policy HTTP header or using HTML meta tag.
HTTP header:
Content-Security-Policy: policy HTML Meta tag:
&amp;lt;meta http-equiv=&amp;#34;Content-Security-Policy&amp;#34; content=&amp;#34;policy&amp;#34;&amp;gt; A policy describes a set of directives composed by the area in which the rule is applied and the rule itself.</description>

      <description>Any modern web application needs soon or later to perform some http request to retrieve data. Here below I&amp;rsquo;ll describe some common scenario and how to perform such requests using RxJS.
Single request The most common scenario, no special rxjs handling, since that Angular provides an Http service that returns an Observable.
services.getItems().subscribe(); Is that easy? Yes. In the particular example, I assumed the http service call was inside the service.</description>

      <description>Sometimes ago we need to create a new product, that shares many functionalities with the existing one. The first idea was to extract some of the code in a library, to be then imported and used independently in the two projects.
After creating the repository for the library, the first action I would have done was copying the files from one repo to another. Well, it works like a charm, it’s fast and it doesn’t require any particular expertise, a normal drag and drop operation.</description>

      <description>Some months ago, I was creating a web page to show some aggregated data, but I soon noticed the API used to retrieve the data was very slow. After investigating on the possible issue, we discovered the bottleneck: the database. The solution was to re-structure the data to make it consumable from a web page.
Although I had used sometimes the SQLServer profiler, I had no experience about MongoDB profiler, so here below the steps involved to analyse a MongoDB query.</description>

      <title>Security Headers on Static Websites</title>

      <description>When I started this blog, I evaluated many options:
 blogging platform vs static-generated website self-hosted vs hosted solutions costs and many more.  I ended up trying to build something very simple, consisting in a static website hosted on GitHub Pages. With this solution, I have been able to cut the cost on any host solution, since that, being a dev, I am quite comfortable in writing in a text editor.</description>
