      <description>When I started this blog, I evaluated many options: - blogging platform vs static-generated website - self-hosted vs hosted solutions - costs - and many more.
I ended up trying to build something very simple, consisting in a static website hosted on GitHub Pages. With this solution, I have been able to cut the cost on any host solution, since that, being a dev, I am quite comfortable in writing in a text editor.</description>

      <description>Preamble This article is not intended to cover the whole testing process due to its vastness. Having a glance at its Wikipedia page could give an idea of it. I am going to cover only the tip of the iceberg, but it is important to remind that bugs cannot be eliminated from the software, but in contrast, they must be discovered as soon as possible.
