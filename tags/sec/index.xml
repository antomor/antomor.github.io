      <description>What is CSP CSP stands for Content Security Policy and it is a security mechanism that helps to protect or mitigate some common attacks such as XSS (Cross-site scripting). It can be set by means of Content-Security-Policy HTTP header or using HTML meta tag.
HTTP header:
Content-Security-Policy: policy HTML Meta tag:
&amp;lt;meta http-equiv=&amp;#34;Content-Security-Policy&amp;#34; content=&amp;#34;policy&amp;#34;&amp;gt; A policy describes a set of directives composed by the area in which the rule is applied and the rule itself.</description>

      <description>When I started this blog, I evaluated many options:
 blogging platform vs static-generated website self-hosted vs hosted solutions costs and many more.  I ended up trying to build something very simple, consisting in a static website hosted on GitHub Pages. With this solution, I have been able to cut the cost on any host solution, since that, being a dev, I am quite comfortable in writing in a text editor.</description>
