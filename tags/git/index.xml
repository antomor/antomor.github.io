      <description>Sometimes ago we need to create a new product, that shares many functionalities with the existing one. The first idea was to extract some of the code in a library, to be then imported and used independently in the two projects.
After creating the repository for the library, the first action I would have done was copying the files from one repo to another. Well, it works like a charm, it’s fast and it doesn’t require any particular expertise, a normal drag and drop operation.</description>
