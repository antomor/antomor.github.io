      <description>In the last projects, I started using GitLab, not only as git repository server, but also as DevOps platform. So here I am going to describe a very simple architecture to deploy a single page application using Docker and docker-compose, nginx. In this specific project I used also dotnet-core for the back-end API and VueJS as front-end framework, but it is language-agnostic, meaning that you can replace whatever back-end or front-end you prefer.</description>

      <description>Preamble This article is not intended to cover the whole testing process due to its vastness. Having a glance at its Wikipedia page could give an idea of it. I am going to cover only the tip of the iceberg, but it is important to remind that bugs cannot be eliminated from the software, but in contrast, they must be discovered as soon as possible.
